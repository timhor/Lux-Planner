        <p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur

        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled 
            dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into 
            a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
            and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
            brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into 
            stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover 
            <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide 
            off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin 
            compared with the size of the rest of him, 
            <a class="external ext" routerLink="/">link</a> waved about 
            helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
            thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
            room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
            between its four familiar walls.
